# 🎓 Student Performance: Predictive Modeling & Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
To apply regression and clustering techniques to a student dataset to examine the key predictors of academic success, specifically identifying social and behavioral variables influencing outcomes. This project focuses on drawing actionable insights for educational policy.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
* Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Techniques: Regression Analysis (Linear/Logistic), Clustering (K-Means), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Hypothesis Testing, Variable Selection.

## 💡 Key Findings
* Key Predictors: Identified social and behavioral variables, such as 'Study Time' and 'Family Support', as having a higher predictive power for final grades than traditional                             demographic data.
* Clustering Insight: Grouped students into distinct clusters based on traits, suggesting targeted intervention strategies for underperforming groups.
* Model Building: Successfully developed regression models to predict final performance metrics, validating statistical significance.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or install the libraries listed above).
3. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook student_performance_analysis.ipynb`
